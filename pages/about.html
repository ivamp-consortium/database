		<p> Some of our first meetings! <br>
			Notice our bird visitor in the first meet. <br> <br>
			The Initiative for Venom Associated Microbes and Parasites (iVAMP) is a collaborative, open-source group of researchers worldwide of all career stages and types with the shared interest to expand the reach of each otherâ€™s work as well as the direction the host-microbe interaction, microbiology, and venomics fields. <p>
		<h2> What is iVAMP's long-term aims? </h2>
		<p> 1) To study venom glands as potential microenvironments for microorganisms. <br>
			2) To establish an inclusive network of scientists interested in microbe- and parasite- venom interactions. <br>
			3) To be a platform for sharing of samples to facilitate access to geographically restricted specimens. <br>
			4) To support the sharing of data through collaboration, and for obtaining a broader view of the research area. <br>
			5) To culminate data from collaborations as an open-source database, free to the public. <br>
			6) To engage the general public with ongoing research projects through continuous inquiry and discussion. <br>
